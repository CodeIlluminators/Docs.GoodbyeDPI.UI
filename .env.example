# GitHub Personal Access Token
# This token is required to authenticate requests to GitHub’s API for fetching
# repository releases and assets without hitting rate limits.
# 
# Purpose:
# The GitHub API limits the number of requests per hour for unauthorized
# requests. By including a GitHub Personal Access Token, you increase the rate
# limit available for your application, allowing it to function without interruptions.
#
# Without this token, you may experience 403 (Forbidden) errors if the app
# exceeds the API’s request limit. GitHub tokens also ensure that your application
# has authorized access to private repositories, if needed.
# 
# How to get your GitHub Personal Access Token:
# 
# 1. Sign in to GitHub: Go to https://github.com/ and login.
# 
# 2. Access Settings:
#    - In the top right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile picture.
#    - Click on **Settings** in the dropdown menu.
#
# 3. Open Developer Settings:
#    - Scroll down and click **Developer settings** in the left sidebar.
#
# 4. Generate Token:
#    - Select **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)** from the left sidebar.
#    - Click on **Generate new token** > **Generate new token (classic)**.
# 
# 5. Configure Token Permissions:
#    - In the **Note** field, add a description (e.g., "Access for My Project").
#    - Set the **Expiration** duration, or leave it as "No expiration" if you want it to last indefinitely.
#    - Under **Select scopes**, choose at least:
#      - `repo` - Grants read and write access to repositories, which allows access to private repositories if needed.
#
# 6. Generate and Copy Token:
#    - Click **Generate token** at the bottom of the page.
#    - GitHub will show your token only once. Copy it immediately and store it in a safe place.
#
# 7. Add Token Here:
#    - Place the token below as the value for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
